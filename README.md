# Scavenger

This is a project using winforms. I made this application to faciliatate retrieving and comparing active directory user groups for different users.

In my scenario, there were situations where I did not have a prebuilt powershell script to accomplish this. So, I decided to build a handy application that could do this for me in the event I could not use powershell in my client's environment.
